define ten x, y coords
visit each point only once, finally returning to starting coord.
two path method.
path_A = start location to closest next.
path_B = start location to second closest next.
grow each path, switching back and forth.
close the path by connecting path_A and path_B.
total minimum distance calculated through above stated approximation method.
